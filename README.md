# What is this project about?
It's a REST library for MQL5. Comprises of a C# dll that deals with the REST communication and an MQL5 sample project.

# Why?
There are numerous examples to call REST API using MQL without a dll. But these examples do not work with backtesting. As a result if you have a functionality in your Expert Advisor (e.g. do not trade during market news) and you have a REST service that provides market news information, it's not possible to call the service from within a backtest. 

# Getting the REST C# DLL
There are two ways to get the DLL. Either [build it from source](https://github.com/cyrus13/rest-mql#option-1-building-dll-from-source), or [get it precompiled for x86 and x64 architectures](https://github.com/cyrus13/rest-mql#option2-precompiled-dll).

## Option 1: Building DLL from Source
The original dll is built using Visual Studio 2017 and .NET library 4.6.1. Clone the reposity. 
### Add the [DLLExport library](https://github.com/3F/DllExport) dependency
Open command prompt and navigate to the folder you cloned: rest-mql/net-dll/restmql. Issue from command prompt: DllExport_Configure.bat
Then select the solution of the project and for the NameSpace for DLLExport choose: System.Runtime.InteropServices
Select (86+x64) as architecture and press Apply. 
### Build the DLL
Restart Visual Studio and the project should compile without errors. Release the DLL for the architecture you want.

## Option2: Precompiled DLL
You can download the precompiled DLL from the [releases page](https://github.com/cyrus13/rest-mql/releases).
